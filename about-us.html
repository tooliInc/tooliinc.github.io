<h3>Lend</h3>

<h4>RENT OUT YOUR TOOLS, EARN EXTRA CASH</h4>
<ul>
<li>Tools collecting dust? Certain tools only used for a specialty job once or twice a year?
Instead of having it sit on a shelf, turn it into extra money in your bank account and pay off
the tool immediately. Earn more than 10% of the value of your tool in just one day. All your
tools are fully insured and being rented by screened individuals and companies
</li>
</ul>
 

<h3>Borrow</h4>

<h4>ANY TOOL FOR ANY JOB</h4>
<ul>
	<li>It’s often not worth buying a tool for a one time job, but the rental cost is so high you want
to buy the tool anyways. We’ve been there and there’s no ‘right’ decision. That tool you
need is often sitting on your neighbour’s shelf. You now have access to that tool for a
fraction of the cost. Connect with a trusted source within your community to rent the tool
from their collection at a price that is often more than half the price or traditional rental
company.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Convenience</h3>
<ul>
<li>Whether you’re borrowing the tool or renting the tool, Tooli just makes life easier. Meet
locally to exchange the tool. Save time and headaches that are usually associated with long
lines at your local rental store.
