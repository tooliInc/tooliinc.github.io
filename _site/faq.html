            <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<h2>I want to rent out some of my tools. How much should I list my tool for?</h2>
<p>You have the freedom to list your tool as high or as low as you want. We recommend
seeing what similar tools are being listed for on Tooli or from a rental company.</p>

<h2>How much should I put for the deposit amount?</h2>
<p>We recommend putting the deposit as you see the value of your tool. Take into account
the tools age and the condition it's in.</p>

<h2>How does the physical exchange of the tool work?</h2>
<p>When you've confirmed to rent a tool or rent one out, you have the freedom to change the
pickup location / meeting place with the other party at an agreed time. When you meet up
with the party renting out the tool, they will show that it's in good working condition. They will
release the tool electronically. The party renting the tool will accept the tool electronically by
clicking on the received tool button to show they now have possession of the tool, which will
also start the rental period.</p>

<h2>What if I need the tool longer than what I rented it out for?</h2>
<p>Simply message the person you're renting the tool from and check online if it's available
for the additional period of time. Assuming it is you can extend the rental period.</p>

<h2>Can I negotiate the price of renting the tool?</h2>
<p>Yes, you are free to inquire and message with the owner of the tool to see if they will
change the price.</p>

<h2>What happens if the tool is in worse condition when it's returned?</h2>
<p>There is a charge to the renter if the tool is damaged in anyway. As the person renting out
the tool, you will be allowed to keep a portion or all of the deposit to cover the damage.</p>

<h2>If I'm renting out my tool how do I get paid?</h2>
<p>If you are renting out a tool, you will be prompted to setup a Stripe account prior to your
first rental transaction. The software will automatically calculate how much income you've
accumulated from renting out your tools. Through your stripe account, you can setup regular
payouts or one-time payouts.</p>

<h2>The renter cancelled right before they were going to pick up the tool. What now?</h2>
<p>The renter can cancel a booking up to 5 days prior to the rental or at any time prior to the
request being accepted by the tool owner. If the booking is cancelled with less than 5 days
notice, there is a fee equivalent to a single day rental for that tool.</p>

<h2>Can I change the pickup location of the tool?</h2>
<p>Yes, when inquiring for a tool rental you can ask the owner if they can meet anywhere
else. If you are the tool owner, you can set the pickup location to anywhere you like under
the tools profile.</p>

<h2>When I sign up for Stripe, I don't have a BN. Is that a problem?</h2>
<p>That is not a problem. This is only for businesses that register to rent out their tools.</p>

<h2>Will I be reminded when a tool should be returned?</h2>
<p>Yes, you will get a notification on the morning of the day the tool is to be returned. You
must return the tool and also click the return button on your electronic device to stop the
rental period.</p>

<h2 id="serviceFees">Does Tooli charge anything to rent out tools?</h2>
<p>To help cover the costs of processing user payments and application
maintenance, a service fee is charged to the owner and renter on every reservation.
The amount of the service fee is listed below.</p>

<table class="table table-striped">
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th></th>
			<th>Fees</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<th>Consumer</th>
			<td>$1 + 3% of rental price</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th>Consumer</th>
			<td>3% of any processed deposit not refunded</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th>Owner</th>
			<td>13% of rental price</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>
