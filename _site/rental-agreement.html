<p>
This is your agreement with the other party as either the equipment owner or renter unless otherwise specified. If any discrepancies or disagreement have occurred, please notify us immediately. Your agreement has been accepted to each other through the application on the express conditions of the below terms and conditions on this Rental Agreement and Disclaimer.
</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	Payment Terms. The registered credit card of the renter will be charged for the amount agreed to plus the agreed deposit amount. The deposit amount will be returned when the tool is returned in the same condition as when it’s rented out.
	</li>

	<li>
	Returns. RENTER agrees to return all items in the same condition as received. The Equipment and Accessories are to be clean, and all cables and hoses must be properly coiled and tied and hardware such as tool heads and batteries placed in their appropriate holder location (as received on date of rental), or RENTER agrees to pay a portion of deposit as agreed. If the Equipment is not returned in good condition on the Return Date, prorated rental fees at the daily rate continue on a daily basis. OWNERS acceptance of the return of the Equipment is a waiver by OWNER of any claims it may have against RENTER, including claims for latent damage to the Equipment. If repairs or replacements are required, RENTER agrees to pay all labor, material and shipping charges which will be withheld from the retained deposit. RENTER shall pay OWNER Full Replacement Value (see paragraph 6 below) to replace any Equipment which is lost, stolen or damaged beyond repair.
	</li>

	<li>
	Indemnity. RENTER shall hold OWNER harmless and indemnify OWNER from all claims, liabilities, damages, costs or losses arising from or related to injury or damage to the Equipment or to persons or property arising from or related to the use, maintenance, storage or transport of the Equipment during the period of RENTER’s responsibility.
	</li>

	<li>
	No Damages, Assumption of Risk. RENTER acknowledges there is a risk of losses, injuries or damages arising from or related to the use or transportation of the Equipment and assumes all risk of such losses, injuries or damages. RENTER for itself and its Customers releases OWNER from any and all responsibility or liability for such losses, injuries or damages which RENTER or its Customers may experience arising from or related to the failure, use, maintenance, storage or transport of the Equipment.
	</li>

	<li>
	Use. RENTER shall use the Equipment in a prudent and proper manner and in compliance with all applicable manufacturer’s specifications and government requirements. RENTER shall not make any alterations, additions, repairs or improvements to the Equipment. The Equipment may not be pledged, used, loaned, sublet or assigned to third parties.
	</li>

	<li>
	Losses &amp; Insurance. The RENTER shall keep the equipment insured against all risks of loss or damage from every cause whatsoever for not less than the Full Replacement Value and shall carry public liability and property damage insurance covering the equipment. Full Replacement Value is agreed to be the "Wholesale Replacement Cost" for each item rented. Upon a loss, the proceeds of such insurance, at the option of OWNER, shall be applied toward either or both of the following: (a) the replacement, restoration, or repair of the equipment; or (b) the payment of the obligations of RENTER hereunder.
	</li>

	<li>
	Default. If RENTER is unable to timely meet any of its obligations to OWNER under this or any other agreement, or if the Equipment is levied upon or seized, RENTER shall immediately notify OWNER and OWNER may pursue whatever remedies it has under the law or in equity. RENTER hereby authorizes OWNER to enter the premises upon which the Equipment is located to take possession and remove all of the Equipment from such site without court order or other process of law and to use what force is reasonably necessary to remove such Equipment. RENTER hereby waives any and all claims or damages occasioned by such entry or removal. All amounts past due shall bear interest at the highest rate permitted by law.
	</li>

	<li>Title to Goods. The Equipment is the sole and exclusive property of OWNER and RENTER has no right, title or interest therein, except as set forth in this Agreement. RENTER will not alter ownership markings on the Equipment. RENTER will keep the Equipment free from the claims of third parties.
	</li>

	<li>
	Specifications, No Warranty. RENTER has selected the Equipment to its own specifications and THERE IS NO WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, THAT THE EQUIPMENT IS MERCHANTABLE OR FIT FOR RENTER’S PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
	</li>

	<li>Legal Fees. If either party shall retain legal counsel or bring an action against the other for matters arising from or related to this Rental Agreement, the unsuccessful party shall pay to the prevailing party reasonable legal fees and other costs incurred, in addition to any other relief to which it may be entitled.
	</li>

	<li>Security Deposit. OWNER shall have the right to levy a security deposit if needed and use all or part of any security deposit given by RENTER to remedy any default under this Rental Agreement or to compensate OWNER for damage to the Equipment. OWNER will return the remaining balance of the security deposit to RENTER.
	</li>

	<li>Governing Law, Venue. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Province of Ontario, without regard to conflict-of-law principles, and RENTER and OWNER agrees that all disputes shall be resolved in Toronto, ON.
	</li>
