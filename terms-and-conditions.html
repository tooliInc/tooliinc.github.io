<h3>4. USER LICENSE</h3>

jurisdiction where access to or use of the Application or any part of it may be illegal or prohibited. It is solely your

you: (i) are authorized to bind that corporation, entity or organization to these Terms and Conditions; and (ii) the corporation,

representatives, agents, assigns, carriers, operators, drivers, delivery personnel or other suppliers for any personal injuries,

death, property damage, loss, theft or other damages or expenses resulting therefrom. </p>

<h3>5. RENTAL AGREEMENTS (<a href="rental-agreement.html">view</a>)</h3>

<p>A Consumer can rent Equipment by contacting the Owner through the Application and concluding a rental agreement with

the Owner.  All rental agreements are concluded solely between the Owner and the Consumer.  Unless the Owner and

Consumer enter into a separate rental agreement, Tooli&#39;s rental agreement (the “Rental Agreement”) shall apply to any

rental made through the Service and the Rental Agreement, the rental description on the Application and these Terms and

Conditions shall be the entire agreement between the Consumer and Owner with respect to such rental.  A Consumer and an

Owner may create and use their own rental terms and/or modify the Rental Agreement provided here as they see fit.  All

obligations under the Rental Agreement (including all payment obligations) are obligations directly between the Consumer

and Owner and are not made by and do not legally bind us.  It is your responsibility to review the Rental Agreement in

advance to determine whether it is suitable for your purpose.   The Rental Agreement is to be used at your own risk and

expense.  You acknowledge and agree that you may be required by an Owner to enter into one or more separate agreements,

waivers or terms and conditions prior to renting or purchasing Equipment and an Owner may place additional restrictions on

your booking, product or service.</p>

 <p>When you use the Service to transact a Rental, the Service will present you with a page confirming the details of the Rental

(the “Rental Confirmation”). By clicking “I Agree” (or any other means of acceptance presented by the Service), you agree to

the terms of that Rental and the Rental Confirmation becomes part of these Terms and Conditions.

The use of Equipment can be extremely dangerous to Users and bystanders and may require skill, knowledge, preparation

and training to operate.  Renting Equipment via the Service may not come with all of the personal protection equipment

required to operate the Equipment.  You should always follow the safety precautions and operation procedures outlined in

the Equipment manufacturer’s owner’s manual.  The use of Equipment (especially the careless or improper use of Equipment

and/or use of the Equipment without appropriate personal protection equipment) poses a risk of causing serious bodily

injury, partial and/or total disability, paralysis and/or death of Users and/or bystanders and causing damage to property

and/or damage to Equipment.  Each User acknowledges there are inherent risks, hazards and dangers involved in using

Equipment.  Always follow all manufacturer’s recommended maintenance and repair guidelines.  BY CONTINUING TO USE

THE SERVICE, YOU: (A) ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THE USE OF EQUIPMENT IS DANGEROUS AND MAY POSE

A RISK TO THE SAFETY OF YOURSELF AND OTHERS AND TO DAMAGE TO PROPERTY; (B) REPRESENT AND

WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE THE REQUISITE SKILL, KNOWLEDGE, PREPARATION AND TRAINING TO OPERATE THE

EQUIPMENT SAFELY AND EFFECTIVELY; AND (C) ASSUME FULL AND COMPLETE RESPONSIBILITY FOR, AND

RELEASE TOOLI IN CONNECTION WITH, ALL LOSSES, COSTS, INJURIES AND DAMAGES THAT YOU OR OTHERS MAY

INCUR AS A RESULT OF USING ANY EQUIPMENT.</p>

<p>Tooli does not qualify or verify Users in any way and does not educate Consumers on the safe handling and operation of

Equipment or safety hazards inherent in using Equipment.  It is the responsibility of each User to engage only in those

activities involving the use of Equipment for which it has the prerequisite skills, qualifications, preparation and training.

 Compliance with all safety, legal and regulatory requirements in connection with any Rental or Sale transaction or the use of

any Equipment is the responsibility of the User and not Tooli. </p>

<p>The Rental Agreement, or other separate waivers or agreements, are not a substitute for the advice of a lawyer and you are

advised to obtain local legal counsel to prepare, review and revise as necessary any rental agreements to ensure compliance

with federal, provincial, state, and local law and their particular circumstances, and to revise such agreements as

necessary.  
</p>

<h3>6. OFFERING EQUIPMENT FOR RENT OR SALE</h3>

<p>An Owner may offer Equipment for Rental or Sale through the Application. Unless otherwise agreed, the Owner must place an

item in an appropriate category, describe it correctly and completely, and truthfully indicate any specific rental or sale terms,

features and characteristics of the item.  The Owner must state the price in the offer and specify any other price

components or additional charges the Consumer will incur (including, without limitation, fuel, damage deposit, delivery, blade

sharpening, etc.), as well as the aggregate total amount.
</p>

<p>An Owner must ensure that their offer of goods or services for sale or rent complies with all applicable laws, including all

applicable health and safety, tax, environmental and regulatory laws.  The Owner has the option of describing Equipment for

rent or sale with images that can be uploaded when placing the item on the Application. Each Owner hereby represents and

warrants that: (a) to the best of your knowledge and belief, all Equipment you offer for Rent or Sale is in good operating

condition and in working order, free of any known faults or defects that would affect its safe operation under normal use;

and (b) by using any images on the Application, no third party rights are infringed, such as copyright or other intellectual

property rights.  The Owner is obliged to provide accurate and complete billing and delivery details. If these details have

changed in any way, the Owner is required to update this information in their user account immediately.</p>

<p>We encourage all Users to use properly completed and documented check-in and check-out inspections for all Rental and

Sale transactions in order to avoid disputes.  Photographic evidence can be used to support or defend a claim against fuel

surcharges, damage, vandalism, repair and other matters.  For example, “before and after” time stamped photos may be

taken with a clear narrative as to what the photo is showing (e.g. fuel tank, run times, etc.). If standard descriptions and

grades are used, these should be clearly explained. </p>

<p>We do not endorse, investigate or verify any Equipment.  All information relating to Equipment and other goods or services

available through the Service come directly from the Owners. Tooli does not control or assume any liability for the accuracy,

completeness and timeliness of this information.  Tooli does not and will not make any representation or warranty, express

or implied, with respect to the Equipment or its adequacy for the User’s purpose or otherwise.  Tooli will have no liability of

any kind, including liability for any indirect or consequential damages, arising from any patent, latent or other defect in the

Equipment, or for any fundamental breach or other failure of performance, capacity or operation of the Equipment.</p>

shall pay all fees, taxes and other amounts owing to the Owner in respect of any Sale or Rental transaction in advance

through the Service.  Tooli does not guarantee payments to Owners for amounts that have not been successfully received by

Tooli from Users.  Each Owner understands that Tooli accepts payments from Users as the Owner’s limited payment

collection agent and that Tooli’s obligation to the Owner is subject to and conditional upon successful receipt of the

associated payments from the Users. </p>

<p>Any fees due to an Owner in respect of any Rental or Sale transaction shall be paid by Tooli upon completion of the rental or

purchase transaction only after funds are received by us, less: (a) the Service Fee plus applicable taxes; (b) any applicable

fees and charges set out on the Fee Schedule plus applicable taxes; (c)  chargebacks and chargeback costs relating to fuel,

<p>As an Owner, you may need to assess value added tax, general sales tax or other taxes on the goods or services you provide.

 We encourage you to consult a tax advisor in your area for more insight on this and assistance assessing tax on the goods

or services you provide if necessary.  It is important that Customers are informed about the exact tax amount prior to

booking.  Tooli may provide general information regarding certain tax rates that may apply to Rental or Sale transactions in

some areas.  However, we are not familiar with your individual tax circumstances and do not provide tax advice.  Any tax

information provided by Tooli is intended as general information only and shall be relied upon entirely at the User’s own risk.</p>
     
<p>Each User understands and agrees that it is solely responsible for determining: (i) its applicable tax reporting requirements;

and (b) the taxes that should be included or charged in any Sale or Rental transaction and for including taxes to be collected

or obligations relating to applicable taxes in offering Equipment for sale or rent through the Service.  Additionally, as an

Owner, your gross earnings may be subject to income tax.  You are solely responsible for remitting to the relevant authority

any taxes included or received by you.  Tooli does not and cannot offer tax-related advice to Users.  You agree to indemnify

and save harmless Tooli and the Third Parties from any loss, damage or liability of kind arising in connection with your

failure to collect, report or remit any taxes relating to your use of the Service or your breach of or failure to comply with any

applicable tax laws.</p>

entering into the transaction and for the duration of the rental period: (a) any tax payer and credit information you supply is

true and complete; (b) charges incurred by you will be honored by your credit card company; and (c) you will pay the posted

price for the goods and services, subject to the terms of any Rental Agreement entered into directly between the Owner and

Consumer. Posted rates should include applicable taxes, fees, disbursements or other charges set out in the Fee Schedule

but not the service fee to the borrower.  We reserve the right to charge each Consumer’s credit card with a damage deposit

in accordance with the Fee Schedule or as set out in the Rental Agreement.
